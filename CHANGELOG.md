# Changelog

Release notes for Forza Painter FH6. The in-app update prompt reads from this file.

## Unreleased

## v1.6.X-beta-3 / 2026-06-03

**v.1.6.X Beta-3** — Text-vinyl stroke tracing, and tooling updates.

- **Text vinyl:** New **Strokes** shape mode — rotated rectangle bars for fewer layers on Latin/CJK traced text.
- **Preview:** Forza in-game font JSON previews use the correct coordinate decode and bounds.
- **Tools:** [delphitools](https://tools.rmv.fyi/) added to Background Removal suggestions (privacy-first browser prep tools).

Download `forza-painter-fh6-v1.6.X-beta-3.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/ShepherdHL/forza-painter-fh6/releases).

## v1.6.X-beta-2 / 2026-06-03

**v.1.6.X Beta-2** — import hotfix for FH6 layer-table safety checks and template capacity messaging.

- Re-validates cached FH6 session layer tables before import; stale addresses trigger automatic re-locate instead of failing mid-write.
- On import failure, clears the session cache and retries auto-locate once before giving up.
- Console and app log now explain **template capacity** (JSON drawable layers + 4 FH boundary layers) separately from **safety check** failures (stale table vs cleared template slots).
- Safety-check errors report strict-valid vs required counts with actionable fixes instead of only `5/1800 strict layers`.

Download `forza-painter-fh6-v1.6.X-beta-2.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/ShepherdHL/forza-painter-fh6/releases).

## v1.6.X (Beta) / 2026-06-02

Beta release of the ShepherdHL **1.6.X** line ([ShepherdHL/forza-painter-fh6](https://github.com/ShepherdHL/forza-painter-fh6)).
Download `forza-painter-fh6-v1.6.X.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/ShepherdHL/forza-painter-fh6/releases).
Not affiliated with upstream Forza Painter or other FH6 fork releases.

### Highlights

- **JSON previews** — FH6-aware previews for generated and Kloudy-style type-code JSON (shared across Preview, Import, Text vinyl, and Pixel art), with cached redraws.
- **Clearer output names** — Generated files keep the original image name; active filter preset is appended as a suffix (on disk and in the generate queue).
- **Optional SIGNATURE.txt** — Per-workspace provenance file (author, repo, version) when enabled in settings.
- **Text vinyl fonts** — Default fonts load immediately; full per-script lists fill in in the background.
- **Workflow split** — Separate Create/Import paths for photo JSON, text vinyl, and pixel art.
- **Files tab** — Workspace overview and cache cleanup presets.

### Known issues

- Layout primarily tested at **1920×1080**.
- First **Image Preview** filter pass per image can take a while.
- Beta: expect rough edges near FH6 layer limits and on integrated GPU generation.

## v1.6.1 / 2026-05-24

- Updated the app version to `v1.6.1`; release packages now use `forza-painter-fh6-v1.6.1.exe`.
- Disabled `luma_band` preprocessing by default in bundled presets.
- Import no longer reuses stale FH6 session data from `webui-data`; it re-locates the current template before writing.
- JSON previews now use one stable renderer path to avoid ellipse preview distortion differences between packaged EXE environments.

## v1.6.0 / 2026-05-24

- Updated the app version to `v1.6.0`; release packages now use `forza-painter-fh6-v1.6.0.exe`.
- Updated the bundled GPU generator to upstream `canary-26052401`.
- Added upstream `errorGridSize` preset support.
- Integrated the upstream transparent-area overhang prevention algorithm adjustment.
- Significantly improved generation quality for the large ellipse at the bottom of transparent images.

## v1.5.4 / 2026-05-23

- Fixed preview scaling for high-resolution source images, generator preview PNG files, and JSON previews.
- Previews now adapt to the current preview panel size while preserving the original image aspect ratio, avoiding stretched or partially visible previews when using large max-resolution settings such as 3000.
- Fixed JSON preview rendering for type 16 rotated ellipses in the packaged EXE by making the Pillow fallback follow the historical OpenCV preview coordinate conversion.

## v1.5.3 / 2026-05-22

- Added user preset import for the one-file EXE; imported `.ini` presets are stored in the external `config/settings/` folder beside the app.
- Added remove buttons for the selected image and selected JSON entries.
- Improved checkpoint handling: existing checkpoint JSON files are detected and reusable checkpoints are added to the Import list after failed or stopped generation.
- Fixed JSON output discovery when source image filenames contain extra dots, such as `image.1png.png`.
- Improved generation progress logs when the GPU generator recycles fully covered layers, so the UI no longer looks like generation restarted from an earlier layer.
- Added a Pillow-based preview fallback and packaged it into the EXE so fresh one-file installs can preview images and JSON without OpenCV.

## v1.5.2 / 2026-05-22

- Added a PyInstaller-based one-file EXE so normal users no longer need to install Python, create `.venv`, or keep helper files beside the app.
- The GUI EXE now re-launches itself in hidden helper mode for import and FH6 memory probing.
- The Tools page and startup log now show where external runtime/cache files are stored.
- Fixed the batch bootstrap variable-expansion bug that could run `-m venv` instead of `python -m venv`.
- Added a repeatable `scripts/make_exe_release.ps1` build script for the one-file EXE package.

## v1.5.1 / 2026-05-22

- Fixed startup dependency installation when a project `.venv` exists but its Python does not have `pip`; the bootstrapper now runs `ensurepip --upgrade` before installing requirements.
- Improved startup-script diagnostics when required release files are missing, with a clear message to fully extract the release ZIP first.

## v1.5.0 / 2026-05-22

- Added a startup update check against the GitHub `main` branch version file.
- When update checking fails, the app shows a small `!` indicator in the top-right corner; clicking it shows the failure reason.
- When a newer version is available, the app displays this changelog section and lets the user open the update page.
- Switched the desktop UI to a dark theme for better contrast during long generation and import sessions.
- Updated the bundled GPU/OpenCL generator to upstream `canary-26052102`.
- Added the upstream work-group evaluation algorithm from PR #4, reducing GPU candidate-evaluation overhead and improving generation throughput on supported OpenCL devices.
- `start_app.bat` now bootstraps the project-local `.venv`: it installs missing dependencies and then launches the app.
- Dependency installation now uses `.venv` instead of installing packages into the global Python environment.

## v1.4.1 / 2026-05-21

- FH6 template auto-location now tries both the v1.3 small/medium-region address-order scan and the v1.4 large-region chunked scan before giving up.
- Added an RTTI vtable fallback locator for difficult FH6 sessions while keeping the existing safe table validation before writing.
- Raised the FH6 auto-location budget to 300 seconds, with a 360-second outer watchdog timeout.
- Added a user-facing wait message before FH6 auto-location starts, warning users to keep the Vinyl Group Editor open and avoid switching menus.

## v1.4.0 / 2026-05-21

- Added detailed log export with a 50000-character output limit.
- Detailed logs include helper/generator raw output, commands, exit codes, process/template state, and current session data.
- Improved FH6 template auto-location by scanning large writable private memory regions in 4 MB chunks.
- Increased the FH6 auto-location scan budget to 120 seconds and the outer watchdog timeout to 160 seconds.

## v1.3.0 / 2026-05-21

- Updated the bundled GPU/OpenCL generator to upstream `canary-26052101`.
- Added the upstream generator device-selection fix, prioritizing NVIDIA GPUs with the most VRAM.
- Generation logs now show the selected OpenCL device.
- Improved FH6 template auto-locate failure handling so stale session cache is not reported as a newly verified template.
